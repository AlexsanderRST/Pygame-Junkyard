# Pygame Junkyard

Pygame projects that were once projects, but are now programmed pieces of garbage

⚠️: You must have python 3 and pygame 2 installed to run the games. To run them, double-click on *Main.py* or *main.py*.

🔨 represents the amount of work put into the project

## Chubby Dragon Chase 🔨🔨🔨🔨
In this game, the player would control a man who has the wife kidnapped by a chubby dragon. So he goes around a dangerous world (where even rocks are enemies) colecting resources and going village to village to ask: 'did you saw the chubby dragon?'. The idea was: every resource comes from enemies. So if want wood, you have to battle against a tree.

In this game, the player would control a robot that falls into a random generated planet. The objective is: refuel the landing module using the resources available to get back to the mother ship.

## The Table Guy 🔨🔨
This is not a game at all, just a guy sitting on a table and you can exit with ESC key. The funny part of it is that a made a documentation of this game with a lot of details how it would work. The ideia was: A political RPG where the protagonist starts in your house's kitchen and raises in the political career using fake news, contacts, dirty bribe; until he become the leader of world. You would also make partnership with political groups like progressists, conservatives, etc.

## Project Particles 🔨
In this game, the player would control a guy who runs a particle store in space. The ideia was: A client shows up and makes a wish. For example, 2 red and 1 yellow particles. You got 2 reds but not a yellow one, so you have have to combine primary colors (R, G, B) particles to create a new with the color needed.
