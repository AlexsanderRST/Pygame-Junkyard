# My Old Pygames

The ideia of this repository is upload games that I created using the Pygame Library, but for some reason I abondonded.

Warning: You'll need python installed to run the games, double clicking Main.py or main.py. If you find a .psd file, use GIMP to open it.

### The Space is Out There (TSOT)
In this game, the player would control a robot that falls into a random generated planet. The objective is: refuel the landing module using the resources available to get back to the mother ship.
What have been done: You can walk with your robot using A and D. Also brake some dirt blocks using LMB.
